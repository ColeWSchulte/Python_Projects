## [Ecommerce Analysis with Python ](https://github.com/ColeWSchulte/Python_Projects/blob/30ccbb5dbb64b33d75b938c223de3e240e4f9691/Ecommerce_Analysis.ipynb)
This project involves analyzing ecommerce data to identify market trends, sales performance, and customer behavior. Using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I cleaned and prepared the data, conducted exploratory data analysis, and visualized key metrics. The dataset includes monthly sales data across 12 months, enabling detailed analysis of sales trends over the year.
